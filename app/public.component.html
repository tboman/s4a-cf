		Science for Africa is a non-profit organization based in New York City, with the mission
		to empower African scientists through research capacity-building. The Science
		for Africa initiative seeks to promote the scientific research enterprise in sub-Saharan Africa
		through the identification of adequate research collaborators, as well as through mentorship
		schemes.

	<p style="margin-left: 400px; text-align: left;text-color:white;">
		The collaboration framework is exposed through this site, providing tools for researchers
		across the world to collaborate and share ideas, propose or request virtual
		lectures, offer assistance with grant and scientific writing,s and offer/request scientific or
		technical equipment.
	</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 400px; text-align: left;text-color:white;">
		This framework allows academic and private sector scientists and
		engineers to sign up, free of charge, to identify, initiate, and pursue productive and
		mutually beneficial collaborations linking the scientific communities in North America and Europe with peers
		in sub-
		Saharan Africa. The system matches requests and offers, based on
		scientific sub-specialty and type of collaboration.
